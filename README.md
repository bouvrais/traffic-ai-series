# Traffic AI Series - Code Repository

This repository contains the complete source code and additional materials accompanying the **AI-Powered Traffic Analysis** series published on Medium.

## About the Series

The series explores how modern AI and computer vision tools have democratized sophisticated traffic monitoring, making it possible to build professional-grade vehicle detection and speed analysis systems using consumer hardware and open-source software.

### Published Articles

1. **[How My Gaming PC Accidentally Became a Real-Time City TrafficÂ Monitor](link-to-part-1)** - Building with consumer hardware
2. **Part 2** - *(coming soon)*
3. **Part 3** - *(coming soon)*

## Repository Structure

- **[part1-scripts/](part1-scripts/)** - Complete Python implementations from Part 1
  - Static vehicle detection with YOLO
  - Video processing with tracking and speed calculation
  - Real-time RTSP stream processing

## Getting Started

Each part of the series includes working code with detailed setup instructions. Start with the README in the relevant directory for requirements and configuration steps.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+** - Core programming language
